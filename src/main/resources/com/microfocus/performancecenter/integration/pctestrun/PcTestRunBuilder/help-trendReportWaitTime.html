	Even though the trend report is shown in LoadRunner Enterprise as ready for download, additional wait time might be required until the report is complete. You can set a wait time between 0 and 300 seconds. 
	<b>Tip</b>: We recommend using '0' (the default setting) which means no wait time. If the trend report displays partial data only, increase to 10 seconds, and wait for the next build. Repeat as necessary until the report contains all the transaction information.
